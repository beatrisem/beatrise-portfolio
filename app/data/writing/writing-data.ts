    'Exploring the Algarve: Volunteering in Faro',
    'A journey through Faro - a glimpse into Portugal’s southern coast beyond the tourist season.',
    `<p>Volunteering at a hostel in Faro, nestled in the Algarve region of Portugal, was an experience unlike any other. It all began when I decided to embark on a months-long journey, traveling while volunteering. My plan was simple—work in exchange for accommodation and food, and explore the diverse landscapes of Portugal, Spain, and Morocco.</p>

    <p>With no prior experience in volunteering abroad, I made sure to choose a hostel with glowing reviews and a vibrant community of volunteers through a trusted third-party platform. This gave me some peace of mind—if things didn’t go as planned, I knew I had somewhere to turn.</p>`,

    `<p>I signed up to work the night shifts at the reception desk. Although I had never worked in hospitality, the slow winter season made it manageable. December and January aren’t peak tourist months in Faro, so my shifts were quiet. I found myself watching movies, and on some nights, even catching a bit of sleep during the long hours. While the downtime was a perk, the nocturnal schedule meant I slept through most of the day, leaving only the late afternoon to explore the city. Despite having days off and never working more than two consecutive nights, the irregular hours left me exhausted and out of sync. If you’re someone who struggles with sleep, I wouldn’t recommend night shifts—but if you’re adaptable, it can be a unique way to experience a place!\</p>

    <p>One of the highlights of my time at the hostel was the people I met. The other volunteers were warm, open-hearted, and always up for an adventure. We bonded over shared experiences, and even after leaving Faro, we’ve stayed in touch. I’m certain that one day I’ll cross paths with them again, whether in their home countries or on future travels.</p>`,

    `<p>Faro itself, while quieter in the off-season, holds a timeless charm. I spent most of my days wandering through the historic center and exploring the peaceful streets of downtown. The marina, overlooking the shimmering waters of Ria Formosa, is especially magical at sunset—a must-see spot for any visitor. One of the more intriguing sites is the Chapel of Bones (Capela dos Ossos), a haunting yet fascinating place with walls lined with human bones. For a stunning panoramic view of the city, climb to the top of the bell tower at Faro Cathedral.</p>

    <p>A short bus ride or bike trip away is Praia de Faro, the city’s beach, stretched along a narrow strip of island. Along its shores are rows of beach houses, and nearby, you’ll find other islands to explore, each with its own unique appeal. Ilha da Culatra offers three distinct beaches—Praia da Ilha da Culatra, Praia dos Hangares, and Praia do Farol, where a lighthouse stands watch. I opted for a trip to the remote Desert Island, accessible only by boat. Praia da Barreta, the island’s beach, is pristine and uncrowded, with a peaceful pathway that brings you even closer to nature.</p>

    <p>If you have the chance to venture beyond Faro, the Algarve’s coastline is home to some of the most spectacular beaches in the world. The secluded beaches near Albufeira, like Praia da Coelha and Praia da São Rafael, are easily accessible and breathtaking, with crystal-clear waters framed by rugged orange cliffs. A visit to Falésia Beach is a must—the dramatic red and white cliffs create a striking contrast against the azure sky. It’s a great spot for hiking, long walks, or just soaking in the scenery.</p>`,

    `<p>The Benagil Cave, a natural wonder of the Algarve, is another must-see. While I missed the chance to visit during my winter trip, the cave is best explored during the high season when boat tours are available. Instead, I set off on a boat trip along the cliffs of Ponta da Piedade near Lagos, where the brilliant blue waters and rugged formations were equally stunning.</p>

    <p>Faro is the perfect base for exploring other towns and cities in the Algarve. A day trip to the quaint town of Tavira, with its Moorish influence and serene riverfront, is well worth the journey. Albufeira, Portimão, and Vilamoura also offer plenty to explore, from bustling markets to beautiful marinas. For a quieter escape, visit the nearby village of Estoi, where the pink-hued Palácio de Estoi and its exquisite gardens transport you to another era.</p>

    <p>The Algarve is an endless tapestry of hidden coves, golden beaches, and charming towns. While my experience in Faro was just a glimpse into this breathtaking region, it left me with lasting memories and a deep appreciation for Portugal’s southern coast. Whether you’re drawn to the ancient streets of Faro, the secluded islands of Ria Formosa, or the dramatic cliffs of the western Algarve, the region offers something for every traveler. My advice? Take your time, embrace the unexpected, and let the Algarve reveal its secrets to you.</p>

    'Four Days in Georgia',
    'An itinerary that captures my personal journey through Georgia, while offering some practical insights for future travelers.',

    `<h2>Day 1: Discovering Tbilisi’s Old City</h2>
    <p>I began my journey in the heart of Tbilisi’s Old Town, instantly captivated by the blend of history and culture that radiates from every corner. As I wandered through the narrow, cobbled lanes, I couldn’t help but admire the colorful wooden balconies and intricate wrought-iron details that speak to the city’s unique fusion of East and West.</p>
    <p>Exploring the local cafes and restaurants was a treat for my taste buds. I indulged in traditional Georgian dishes like khachapuri, a heavenly cheese-filled bread, and khinkali, delicious meat-filled dumplings. I also couldn’t resist trying the famous pomegranate juice, sold to me by a friendly lady who swore by its health benefits, claiming it’s “good for the blood.” While the hospitality in Georgia is heartwarming, I did notice that in tourist-heavy areas like Tbilisi, prices can sometimes be inflated if you're not careful. Hearing me speak English, vendors occasionally tried to charge higher rates.</p>
    <p>Next, I made my way to the Georgian Museum of Fine Arts, where I immersed myself in an eclectic collection that spans centuries. The vivid colors and mixed-media pieces—featuring materials like burnt wood and buttons—were particularly striking. For me, art museums always offer a window into the soul of a country, revealing its historical struggles, everyday life, and evolving identity.</p>
    <p>No visit to Tbilisi is complete without a hike up to Narikala Fortress, an ancient citadel dating back to the 4th century. The climb was steep, but the panoramic views of the city, nestled in the valley with the Kura River winding through, were more than worth the effort. From the top, Tbilisi’s history and beauty unfolded beneath me.</p>
    <p>Later, I crossed the Bridge of Peace, a sleek, modern structure of glass and steel that contrasts with the city’s historical architecture. The bridge offers stunning views over the river, especially at sunset. I found a perfect rooftop spot overlooking the bridge and the old city, where I sat down to sketch the scene, capturing the blend of old and new Tbilisi.</p>
    <p>I stayed at Old Meidan Hotel, a cozy spot right in the Old Town. The location couldn’t have been better for walking around, and the hotel’s breakfast buffet—with both traditional Georgian dishes and more familiar options—was a great way to start each day. The view from my room, looking out over the city, made it even better.</p>`,

    `<h2>Day 2: A Day Trip to Kazbegi</h2>
    <p>On the second day, I joined a day tour to Kazbegi, a region I’d been eager to explore. Our first stop was the mesmerizing Zhinvali Reservoir, where the turquoise waters shimmered against the backdrop of mountains turning shades of red and orange in the autumn light. The scenery felt otherworldly.</p>
    <p>We then headed to Ananuri Fortress, an ancient stronghold overlooking the reservoir. As I wandered through the fortress’s towers and medieval churches, the history came alive around me. The views were spectacular, and I found myself lingering here, taking it all in.</p>
    <p>We stopped for lunch in Pasanauri, a village known for khinkali, and of course, I couldn’t pass up the chance to taste these famous dumplings again. I also took a moment to sketch the surrounding hills, their rich autumnal hues perfect for watercolor.</p>
    <p>Next, we arrived at the Gudauri Viewpoint, a scenic spot with a vibrant tiled mural and sweeping views of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The mountain air was crisp and refreshing, and I stood there, taking in the landscape of snow-capped peaks and rolling hills in shades of yellow and brown. There were horses nearby, adding to the scene’s cinematic quality—straight out of a movie like The Lord of the Rings.</p>
    <p>Finally, we reached Gergeti Trinity Church, perched at 2,170 meters. The short climb to the church was well worth it. Set against the awe-inspiring backdrop of Mount Kazbek, the church itself seemed almost ethereal. Our guide mentioned that the mountain often hides behind clouds, but I was lucky that day—the sun broke through, and Kazbek stood revealed in all its glory, crowned by a soft cloud.</p>`,

    `<h2>Day 3: A Day Trip to Kakheti</h2>
    <p>On the third day, I joined another guided tour, this time heading to Kakheti, Georgia’s premier wine region. Though I’m not a wine drinker, the breathtaking landscapes alone made the trip worthwhile. The valleys were a patchwork of orange and gold, with the occasional church spire punctuating the horizon.</p>
    <p>Our first stop was Badiauri, a village famous for its cheese and bread. The aroma of freshly baked bread was irresistible, and I tasted some local sulguni cheese, still warm. I bought extra for a snack, which turned out to be perfect for later in the day.</p>
    <p>We then visited Bodbe Monastery, the resting place of St. Nino, the patron saint of Georgia. The monastery itself dates back to the 9th century, and its serene gardens offered stunning views of the autumnal hills. As I sat there, nibbling on my cheese, I befriended a local cat, who happily shared my snack. Clearly, even the cats here have a taste for fine Georgian food!</p>
    <p>Next, we arrived in Signagi, known as the “City of Love.” Walking through its picturesque streets, I was enchanted by the brightly colored houses and panoramic views over the Alazani Valley. I spent some time walking along the city’s ancient walls, soaking in the views and snapping photos.</p>
    <p>The day ended in Kvareli, where I toured a local winery. Georgia’s wine-making tradition is ancient, stretching back over 8,000 years, and what fascinated me most was their use of qvevri—large clay vessels buried underground for fermentation. Though I didn’t join the wine tasting, I appreciated the depth of the tradition and craftsmanship behind each bottle.</p>`,

    `<h2>Day 4: More of Tbilisi</h2>
    <p>On my last day in Tbilisi, I made the climb to the Mother of Georgia statue, a towering symbol of the nation’s strength and hospitality. The statue, standing high on a hill, holds a sword in one hand and a bowl of wine in the other—a perfect representation of Georgia’s warrior spirit and its legendary hospitality. I took my time sketching the statue and the view, enjoying the peacefulness of the moment.</p>
    <p>Afterward, I explored the neighborhood of Vake, known for its vibrant cafes and leafy streets. I strolled through Vake Park, one of Tbilisi’s most beloved green spaces, and relaxed by the lake, snacking on churchkhela—a traditional sweet made from nuts and grape juice.</p>
    <p>Before my trip came to an end, I visited the Dry Bridge Flea Market, a treasure trove of antiques and handmade crafts. From old Soviet memorabilia to beautiful jewelry, the market had an array of fascinating items. I spent a couple of hours browsing the stalls, finding a few unique souvenirs to bring home.</p>
    <p>In the evening, I treated myself to dinner at a restaurant with live traditional music and dance, which was the perfect way to conclude my Georgian adventure. As I reflected on my four days here, I knew I’d leave with vivid memories of Georgia’s warm people, stunning landscapes, and rich cultural tapestry.</p>`,

  //   'Savoring Georgia: Must-Eat Dishes from the Caucasus',
  //   'A guide to must-eat dishes in Georgia, from hearty khachapuri to fragrant khinkali.',
  //
  //   `<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. With its warm-hearted people, rich history, delectable cuisine, and breathtaking scenery, it quickly became one of my favorite travel destinations.</p>
  //
  //   <p>Food holds a place of special honor in Georgian culture, and no discussion of Georgia is complete without mentioning its culinary delights. My top recommendation is khinkali—plump, meat-filled dumplings that burst with flavorful broth. But be careful not to burn your tongue! To properly eat khinkali, grasp the dumpling by its little “handle,” take a small bite, sip the hot broth, and then enjoy the rest. Vegetarian versions are also available in many places, offering delicious alternatives for non-meat eaters.</p>`,
  //
  //   `<p>One memorable spot I visited with a local friend was Zakhar Zakharich, a restaurant near the Dry Bridge. While the service was slow, the food more than made up for it. I particularly loved the fried dumplings, which added a crispy twist to the traditional khinkali experience.</p>
  //
  //   <p>If you’re an eggplant lover, you’re in for a treat. This humble vegetable has a special place in Georgian cuisine. Among the myriad of aubergine dishes, you&#39;ll find Ajapsandali, a spicy eggplant stew, and eggplant caviar. However, the standout for me was nigvziani badrijani—walnut-stuffed eggplant rolls. The rich, toasted walnuts blended with aromatic spices, wrapped in tender slices of baked or fried eggplant, offer an addictive combination of textures and flavors.</p>`,
  //
  //   `<p>No journey through Georgian cuisine would be complete without trying khachapuri beloved national dish. There are several regional variations of this cheesy bread, but all are irresistibly satisfying. A favorite of mine was the Ajarian khachapuri, with its boat-shaped crust, topped with an egg nestled in gooey cheese. Another variation, the Megruli khachapuri, is made with Sulguni cheese, both inside the dough and on top. For vegetarians, lobiani is a must-try alternative—this version features a hearty kidney bean filling.</p>
  //
  //   <p>For soup lovers, kharcho is a must-taste dish. This hearty, aromatic soup is one of Georgia’s most famous culinary treasures. It features a rich tomato base, seasoned with garlic, coriander, and a unique blend of Georgian spices. Traditionally made with beef, kharcho is slow-cooked until the flavors meld, and then served with shotis puri, a rustic Georgian bread. Be prepared, though—it can pack quite a spicy punch!</p>`,
  //
  //   `<p>If you’re a honey enthusiast, Georgian honey is a hidden gem. On my way to the majestic Kazbegi mountains, I couldn’t resist stopping to buy several varieties: linden, blossom, and mountain flower honey. For those with more refined tastes, Jara honey is a must-try—a rare, top-quality organic wild honey that reflects the pristine environment in which it is harvested.</p>
  //
  //   <p>Honorable Mentions: Georgia’s food scene offers countless other delights. Don’t miss shkmeruli, crispy fried chicken bathed in a garlicky butter or milk sauce; churchkhela, candy made with grape juice and nuts, often referred to as “Georgian Snickers” (but with noadded sugar!); and chicken tabaka, pan-fried with traditional spices. Each dish tells a story of Georgia’s rich culinary heritage.</p>
  //
  //   <p>In Georgia, every meal is an adventure, and its cuisine is an essential part of any travel experience. Whether you’re exploring Tbilisi’s vibrant streets or the serene countryside, let your taste buds guide you through the soul of this remarkable country.</p>`,

    'Why Video Lessons Will Never Replace School Teachers',
    '“Teachers are a dying profession. I can learn better from YouTube videos, and AI can explain things more clearly than someone who doesn’t know everything about their subject.” That’s what an acquaintance said to me during a recent conversation about my job as a school teacher. At first glance, there’s some truth to this. If you want to dive deep into a specific topic, platforms like YouTube or online courses can be helpful.',

    <p>“Teachers are a dying profession. I can learn better from YouTube videos, and AI can explain things more clearly than someone who doesn’t know everything about their subject.” That’s what an acquaintance said to me during a recent conversation about my job as a school teacher.</p>

    <p>At first glance, there’s some truth to this. If you want to dive deep into a specific topic, platforms like YouTube or online courses can be helpful. Books, scientific articles, and self- study are valuable tools. No teacher can force knowledge into a mind that isn’t engaged, and with enough determination, a person can certainly learn a lot independently. But let’s not forget that these materials — whether videos or articles — are often created by teachers, academics, and experts who have spent years honing their understanding of the subject.</p>`,

    `<p>My argument, however, is not about the value of independent learning. It’s about whether teachers in classrooms can or should be replaced by screens. Is it even possible? We had a glimpse of this experiment during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools were forced online. But as someone who has worked in a school, I can confidently say that a teacher in the classroom is irreplaceable.</p>

    <p>School, especially for younger children, is about far more than absorbing facts. It’s a space where kids learn social skills, teamwork, boundaries, and self-regulation. This is especially true for children with attention difficulties or on the autism spectrum. A teacher’s role isn’t just to transmit knowledge; it’s to guide students through social interactions, help them navigate disagreements, and create an environment where learning happens through collaboration and play.</p>

    <p>You can’t simply put 20 seven-year-olds in a room, press play on a video about multiplication, and expect them to sit quietly and absorb the content. Learning, particularly for younger children, is an active process. It requires movement, interaction, and the opportunity to express ideas in different ways — through drawing, discussing, and working in teams. Teachers facilitate these activities, ensuring that students stay engaged and on track. They also provide much-needed supervision, especially when discussions veer into inappropriate territory, as children are still learning what’s acceptable to say in a school setting versus at home.</p>`,

    `<p>There are countless moments where a teacher, simply by observing or overhearing, can unlock a student’s potential. It could be something as small as encouraging a child to lead a group activity, giving them the confidence to take on more challenges. These small but significant moments help shape children into confident individuals who know how to work with others, pursue their interests, and face challenges head-on.</p>

    <p>Without teachers in the classroom, many of these life skills would be lost. Schools would become sterile environments focused purely on the transfer of information, neglecting the development of social and emotional intelligence that is equally critical to success in life.</p>

    <p>A teacher is not just a deliverer of lessons — they are mentors, guides, and role models. In a world where so much of our learning can happen through screens, we must not forget that the human connection teachers provide is irreplaceable. They remain, and will always be, one of the most important professions in shaping the future.</p>

    <p>If you’ve spent any time on TikTok, you know the drill—millions of users sharing their take on everything from work and wellness to beauty tips and success hacks. Often, they’re selling something, whether it’s a product or the allure of online fame. But amid the noise, a particular trend stands out: the rising obsession with natural remedies.</p>

    <p>This fascination with "natural" solutions isn’t new. The beauty and wellness industries have long capitalized on the appeal of so-called “ancient wisdom” or “grandma’s recipe,” packaging products as the answer to everything from dry skin to thinning hair. What TikTok has done, however, is supercharge these trends. A fad that once took months to gain traction can now sweep through millions of feeds in mere days.</p>

    <p>Take a quick scroll through TikTok’s beauty and wellness spaces, and you’ll find an array of supposed miracle cures: rosemary water or rice water for hair growth, oil pulling to improve oral health, DIY coffee scrubs, or the latest—starting your day with half a litre of hot lemon water and salt to "detoxify" your system. Some of these remedies may have merit; others, not so much. But what’s fascinating isn’t just the remedies themselves—it’s the way people engage with them.</p>`,

    `<p>In the comments, you’ll see hundreds of people eager to try these new techniques, asking for advice or sharing their personal experiences. And there’s always someone willing to vouch for the latest "miracle" product. The speed at which these trends spread, and the fervor with which people embrace them, is astounding.</p>

    <p>But this thirst for natural solutions isn’t just about hair growth or glowing skin. It taps into a deeper, growing unease about the products we consume daily. Documentaries like *Toxic Beauty* or apps like *Think Dirty*, which expose the harmful ingredients lurking in cosmetics and hygiene products, fuel a rising distrust in the health and beauty industries. People are searching for transparency, clarity, and simplicity—and nature seems to offer that. After all, if everything comes from nature, why not cut out the middleman?</p>

    <p>This craving for &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; living is partly driven by fatigue. Every week, it seems, there’s a new revelation about something harmful in our everyday lives. Just recently, reports surfaced about dangerous chemicals found in women’s hygiene products like tampons and pads—an issue that was met with alarming indifference, as though it were old news. We’ve had to become hyper-vigilant, scrutinizing not just the food we eat but also the products we apply to our skin.</p>`,

    `<p>And here lies the appeal of TikTok’s natural remedy craze. It’s mentally easier to follow a DIY recipe endorsed by a hundred positive comments than to decipher the cryptic labels on a drugstore face mask or fork out for an expensive, supposedly &quot;clean&quot; alternative. People think, &quot;It’s natural—what harm can it do?&quot; But therein lies the danger.</p>

    <p>The truth is, “natural” doesn’t always mean safe. Stories abound of people suffering skin reactions, dental problems, or even poisoning after following one of these home remedies. Just because something is plant-based or homemade doesn’t mean it’s harmless. Even natural substances can have side effects or interact dangerously with other treatments. Vigilance is still necessary, even when using ingredients from your kitchen cupboard.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, it’s your body, and you can choose whatever path feels right for you. But it’s disheartening that neither the commercial products on our shelves nor the so-called natural remedies found online are safe by default. The uncomfortable truth is this: ignorance won’t protect you from the consequences, no matter how natural or trustworthy something seems.</p>

    <p>As we navigate this world of wellness, we must remember that no remedy—natural or not—is free from risk. And perhaps what we’re really craving isn’t just nature, but honesty, and safety in the products we trust with our health.</p>
